## Speckle noise removal and segmentation of Breast Ultrasound Cancer Images 

## Thesis Project: Prof.Debashree Guha Adhya [Mayâ€™22- Present]




Objective - 1 :- Speckle noise reduction of breast cancer images using autoencoder. The purpose is to help doctors/clinician to increase the quality of the images for better view of biomedical images. So, it reduces the risk of the doctor to falsely interpret the biomedical images.

Objective - 2 :- Implementation of the standard U-Net model for breast cancer ultrasound image segmentation. The motive to use the U-Net model is to localize the area of interest or to find the position or to segment out the cancer growth portion from the BUS Images.
